# spaceship-shooters
 Simple game made with pygame, inspired by space invaders.

To begin playing, execute the main.py script and a pygame window will appear.

Left click with the mouse button to start the game.

Enemy ships will fly from the top of the screen towars you and shoot lasers in your direction.
Destroy enemy ships before they cross the bottom of the screen. You lose a life (top left of the screen)
when an enemy crosses.

You lose health both when you get shot by an enemy laser and when you collide with an enemy ship.

The game is lost when you lose either all your health or all your lives.
